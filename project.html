        <p><span style="font-size:25px">“IoT based solution for monitoring of pollution through pesticide in fresh fruits and vegetable available in markets”.</span> <br>Project Description: The project is based on agriculture domain .We design an application to monitor/analysed/quality of pesticides on  fruit and vegetable using NodeMCU.
            The proposed system here is an efficient and simple algorithm to detect the pests in various
            fruits in the early stage. since the system also helps in less use of pesticides. Real-time
            results can be achieved for industries requiring fast process analysis. Measurement is a
            rapid and non-destructive technique Profit to peoples and Systems should be updated. In
            the future, this product may have high potential for fruits marketing. In our project the
            pesticide on fruits detects with the help of NIR Sensor. Whatever the values or weather the
            fruit is fresh or not sent on our website. Then we can easily analysis our report.

        <p><span style="font-size:24px">The ROBOT was designed to Welcome to the Human beings in the campus. </span> We use Arduino controller for this project.
            A robot is an electro-mechanical machine that is directed by a circuitry or a computer program.Robots have exchanged humans in the aid of performing continuous and dangerous tasks which humans choose not to do. Present robots are classified into different categories based on their features and performance like industrial robots, commercial robots, service robots, mobile robots. Here is a service robot which performs the continuous tasks to welcome the people by a representing “Namaste” through a recorded voice message. Generally, when we invite people to home, parties, marriage functions, office, etc. We need to arrange a person to greet and invite them at the entrance. If the amount of the people is low, then the task is simpler. But if you greet hundreds of people, then the task is difficult. To overcome this problem, here is a project, namely namaste robot with voice control.</p>

        <h1 class="large-font" style="color:rgb(20, 151, 79);"><b>Low cost Automatic Dishwasher Machine</b></h1>
        <p> As we know that 21st century is moving very fastly towards Automation so Automation is the todays main area of working. We are going to develop a machine based on engineering logics and tricks, to reduce the efforts and to save precious time of human being. To move towards the least crisis of budget we will provide Low Cost Automatic Dishwasher Machine which will have effective cleanliness of dishes ,low usage of water and power saviour features .Wastage of water can be minimized by recycling  water by using low cost filter. Annoying sound of dishes during washing will be reduced in this machine.

            Arduino Uno is a micro-controller board used to control the dishwasher machine. When dishes are kept in dishwasher it will sensed by IR sensors and then dish will pick up by gripper from stack of dishes and place in a conveyor belt. In a conveyor belt dish will be placed vertically and hold by side holders . In first stage of dishwasher machine water will sprinkle on dish to remove the waste food particles . In second stage dish moves forward with the help of conveyor belt and wash by scrubber which will contain liquid soap . Scrubber will clean the dishes from both the side. In third stage dish will be clean by water two-three times , also in  this stage filtering is done and filtered water is reused to clean food particles in first stage . At last dishes will be dried.  When work is done the machine will switched off automatically and it will informed to the user via the Alarm/Buzzer. Operation of machine is noiseless.
